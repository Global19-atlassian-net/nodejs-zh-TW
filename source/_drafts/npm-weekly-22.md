## the npm 3 backstory on nodeup

Wondering how we got to npm 3? [Rebecca](https://twitter.com/ReBeccaOrg), [Forrest](https://twitter.com/othiym23), and [Kat](https://twitter.com/maybekatz) give you the full backstory and latest news on the [NodeUp Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/nodeup/89-an-npm-3-show).

## npm 3 beta testers: upgrade to 3.1.2!

It turns out there was a bug in npm@3.1.1 (which made it hard to download modules locally), so Rebecca [released a new version](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.1.2) out of cycle yesterday. You can upgrade with `npm install -g npm@v3.x-next`.

## speaking of upgrading (windows users)…

If you want to upgrade npm on windows, check out [npm-windows-upgrade](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade).

Upgrading npm on Windows requires manual steps to ensure that PowerShell/CMD find the new version of npm. This is a small tool made by Microsoft DX engineers with :heart: for npm and Node, reducing the process to a simple command.

## confused about prepublish?

[Stephan Bönnemann](https://twitter.com/boennemann) [explains the confusion](https://medium.com/@boennemann/what-is-npm-s-prepublish-and-why-is-it-so-confusing-a948373e6be1) around the prepublish lifecycle script and why its quirky behavior is actually more helpful than it may seem.
